git init
```

2. Add your GitHub repository as remote (if not already done):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
```

3. Stage the changes:
```bash
git add pyproject.toml
```

4. Commit the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix: Add Poetry configuration for Render deployment"
```

5. Push to GitHub:
```bash
git push origin main
```

Once you've pushed these changes:
1. Wait for a few minutes for Render to detect the new commit
2. Render will automatically start a new deployment
3. The Poetry error should be resolved as the proper configuration is now in place

Important: Make sure all your environment variables are set in Render:
- SESSION_SECRET
- DATABASE_URL
- DISCORD_CLIENT_ID
- DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET
- DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI

Note: If you haven't initialized git or connected to GitHub yet,  the steps above to commit and push your changes.  If you are initializing a new repository on GitHub, follow the original steps below.


1. First, create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository (e.g., "edusphere-landing")
   - Choose if you want it to be public or private
   - Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

2. Add your files and make your first commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
